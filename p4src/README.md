# P4 Source Code for Intrusion Detection System

This directory contains the P4 program that implements the data plane logic for a signature-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) on a P4-enabled switch.

## Files

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ids.p4` | The main P4 source code. |
| `ids.json` | The compiled JSON output for the BMv2 software switch. |
| `ids.p4i` | An intermediate representation file generated by the compiler. |

## Compilation

The P4 program is compiled for the `v1model` architecture targeting the BMv2 software switch.

To compile the source code (`ids.p4`), run the following command from this directory:

```bash
p4c -b bmv2 --arch v1model ids.p4 -o .
